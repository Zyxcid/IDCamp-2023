If you want to see the html preview, you can copy the html's link and [go here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/)

or you can select **Raw** to view the source code for your file. Once you have the page open, change the URL from *raw.githubusercontent.com* -> *raw.githack.com* and hit enter. Voila! You can view your HTML file directly!
